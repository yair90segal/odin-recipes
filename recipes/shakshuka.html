    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
        Shakshuka (or shakshouka) is a traditional Tunisian dish featuring poached eggs in a spicy tomato sauce with onions, bell pepper, and garlic.
        It's usually eaten for breakfast, but I think it makes a tasty lunch or dinner, served with lots of bread to mop up the sauce.
